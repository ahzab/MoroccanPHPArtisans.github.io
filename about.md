## Moroccan PHP Artisans

The Moroccan web scene has made a huge step forward to becoming more mature. With the launch of many big and medium web projects and the IT startup philosophy starting to get hold in the country, the demand on talented web developers is high as never before.

Such movement needs people to maintain it, push it forward, and keep it on the right path through open debates, meetups and conferences promoting new technologies, modern tools and best practices.

However the Moroccan web community is far behind in its mission.

Thus, we, five Moroccans who care about PHP and what we build with it, decided to create the Moroccan PHP Artisans user group. With our motto : fellowship and contribution, we seek to bring developers together to share knowledge and help the Moroccan web community grow stronger.

PHP is our primary focus, but we are in no way restricted, you can think of us as a user group of web based technologies. But, as we are just starting and each one of us, your fellow organizers, is doing this for the first time, we chose to focus on one PHP framework for the time being. And we picked [Laravel](http://laravel.com). Its [potential](http://www.sitepoint.com/best-php-frameworks-2014/), its awesome community and its growing ecosystem, made it our first choice.

Developers, designers, entrepreneurs, business owners, anyone interested in learning, networking and sharing knowledge, come meet, exchange ideas and talk about code and innovation. All skill levels and backgrounds are welcome.
