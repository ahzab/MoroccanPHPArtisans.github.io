<h1>Some of the folks who support our community.</h1>
<p>These are the businesses that have given back to the community for our monthly meetings.</p>

<p>If you'd like to sponsor a meeting to promote your product/service or get the word out that your hiring then it's as easy as posting "Hi all, I'd like to sponsor one of the meetings." to the <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">mailing List</a>.</p>


{% for sponsor in site.data.sponsors %}
	<h2>{{ sponsor.name }}</h2>
	<a href="{{ sponsor.link }}"><img src="/images/{{ sponsor.logo }}"/></a>
